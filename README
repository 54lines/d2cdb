fifty-four is a 54lines.com compliance checker.

usage: d2cdb [-tTmM] path/to/dir target_cdb tmp_cdb
    
    d2cdb takes a path/to/dir and recursively maps the file contents of the
    directory into a cdb keyed on the relative path to the file (from root
    path/to/dir).

    d2cdb attempts to use the cdbmake program (http://cr.yp.to/cdb/cdbmake.html)
    passing argv2 and argv3 unless the -t option is specified, in which case 
    it uses tinycdb's 'cdb' program (http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/tinycdb.html) with
    the -c option, passing argv3 to cdb's -t (tmp) option and argv2 as argv1.

    When the -m option is passed, d2cdb will recursively map the file contents
    of the directory into a cdb keyed on the relative leaf-directory path, using
    the filename to order the leaf-directory key.

Install: 

    ./installer -p <prefix>

    Will install d2cdb in <prefix>/bin (prefix defaults to /usr/local/).
    
Exit Codes:
      0) success
    100) improper usage
    111) temporary failure (typically no cdbmake/cdb, or argv1 is not a dir)

Dependencies:
    + Bourne Shell (/bin/sh)
    + cdbmake or cdb
